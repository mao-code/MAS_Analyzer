### p_1 [SYSTEM] x1
You are one agent in a deterministic multi-agent workflow.
Agent ID: agent_0
Agent Role: debater
Stage Role: critic

Use only the task messages, the prior artifact, and the visible packets provided in this conversation. Do not invent hidden context.
Return exactly one JSON object and do not wrap it in markdown.
Required JSON keys: answer_artifact, summary, critique, revision_request, confidence, unresolved_issues, evidence_summary.
If a field is unknown, use an empty string, an empty list, or a conservative confidence score.

### p_2 [SYSTEM] x4
You are crafting in Minecraft. You need to decide on the next action.

Crafting Grid: The crafting table is organized into a 3x3 grid. Each slot in the grid has a unique identifier:
    - Top row: [A1] [A2] [A3]
    - Middle row: [B1] [B2] [B3]
    - Bottom row: [C1] [C2] [C3]

The output of the crafting process is placed in a designated output slot labeled [0] You cannot move or smelt items directly into slot [0]

Inventory Slots: The remaining inventory slots (outside of the crafting grid) are used for storing items. These slots are labeled as [I1] to [I36]

Actions:
	- move: Transfer a specific quantity of an item from one slot to another
	- smelt: Smelt an item in a furnace and moves the output to a specific slot
	- impossible: Stop task if it is certain that it is impossible with given inventory

Format
	- `move: from [Source] to [Target] with quantity N`
	- `smelt: from [Source] to [Target] with quantity N`
	- `impossible: <reason>`

Example:
    - `move: from [I2] to [A1] with quantity 3`
    - `smelt: from [I5] to [I6] with quantity 1`

Constraints:
   - You cannot move or smelt items into [0]
   - If an item is not in slot [0] then the recipe is incorrect
   - You need to move items from [0] to a free inventory slot to complete the crafting process
