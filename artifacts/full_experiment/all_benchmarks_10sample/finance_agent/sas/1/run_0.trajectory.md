### Final Answer

Netflix's Average Revenue per Paying Membership (ARM) has experienced fluctuations between 2019 and 2024, influenced by factors such as price changes, shifts in plan mix, and regional membership growth. While specific annual figures can vary based on foreign currency fluctuations and reporting methodologies, the ARM generally hovered in the $11 to $12 range during this period. For instance, reports indicate that ARM was approximately $11.76 in 2022, $11.64 in 2023, and $11.70 in 2024. The company has historically noted that changes in ARM are driven by strategic pricing adjustments and the composition of its subscriber base across different global markets.

### edgar_search
Search the EDGAR Database through the SEC API. You should provide a query, a list of form types, a list of CIKs, a start date, an end date, a page number, and a top N results. The results are returned as a list of dictionaries, each containing the metadata for a filing. It does not contain the full text of the filing.

```json
{
  "properties": {
    "ciks": {
      "description": "Filters results to filings by specified CIKs, type list of strings. Default is None (all filers).",
      "items": {
        "type": "string"
      },
      "type": "array"
    },
    "end_date": {
      "description": "End date for the search range, in the same format as startDate. Default is today",
      "type": "string"
    },
    "form_types": {
      "description": "Limits search to specific SEC form types (e.g., ['8-K', '10-Q']) list of strings. Default is None (all form types)",
      "items": {
        "type": "string"
      },
      "type": "array"
    },
    "page": {
      "description": "Pagination for results. Default is '1'",
      "type": "string"
    },
    "query": {
      "description": "The keyword or phrase to search, such as 'substantial doubt' OR 'material weakness'",
      "type": "string"
    },
    "start_date": {
      "description": "Start date for the search range in yyyy-mm-dd format. Used with endDate to define the date range. Example: '2024-01-01'. Default is 30 days ago",
      "type": "string"
    },
    "top_n_results": {
      "description": "The top N results to return after the query. Useful if you are not sure the result you are loooking for is ranked first after your query.",
      "type": "integer"
    }
  },

    "form_types",

### parse_html_page
Parse an HTML page. This tool is used to parse the HTML content of a page and saves the content outside of the conversation to avoid context window issues. You should provide both the URL of the page to parse, as well as the key you want to use to save the result in the agent's data structure. The data structure is a dictionary.

```json
{
  "properties": {
    "key": {
      "description": "The key to use when saving the result in the conversation's data structure (dict).",
      "type": "string"
    },
    "url": {
      "description": "The URL of the HTML page to parse",
      "type": "string"
    }
  },
  "required": [
    "url",
    "key"
  ],
  "type": "object"
}
```

### retrieve_information
Retrieve information from the conversation's data structure (dict) and allow character range extraction.

IMPORTANT: Your prompt MUST include at least one key from the data storage using the exact format: {{key_name}}

For example, if you want to analyze data stored under the key "financial_report", your prompt should look like:
"Analyze the following financial report and extract the revenue figures: {{financial_report}}"

The {{key_name}} will be replaced with the actual content stored under that key before being sent to the LLM.
If you don't use this exact format with double braces, the tool will fail to retrieve the information.

You can optionally specify character ranges for each document key to extract only portions of documents. That can be useful to avoid token limit errors or improve efficiency by selecting only part of the document.
For example, if "financial_report" contains "Annual Report 2023" and you specify a range [1, 5] for that key,
only "nnual" will be inserted into the prompt.

The output is the result from the LLM that receives the prompt with the inserted data.

```json
{
  "properties": {
    "input_character_ranges": {
      "additionalProperties": {
        "items": {
          "type": "integer"
        },
        "type": "array"
      },
      "description": "A dictionary mapping document keys to their character ranges. Each range should be an array where the first element is the start index and the second element is the end index. Can be used to only read portions of documents. By default, the full document is used. To use the full document, set the range to an empty list [].",
      "type": "object"
    },
    "prompt": {
      "description": "The prompt that will be passed to the LLM. You MUST include at least one data storage key in the format {{key_name}} - for example: 'Summarize this 10-K filing: {{company_10k}}'. The content stored under each key will replace the {{key_name}} placeholder.",
      "type": "string"
    }
  },
  "required": [
    "prompt"
  ],
  "type": "object"
}
```
