### Final Answer

Lionel Messi is widely considered one of the greatest footballers of all time. Born in Rosario, Argentina, in 1987, he spent the vast majority of his professional career at FC Barcelona, where he developed into a global superstar, winning numerous league titles and UEFA Champions League trophies. In 2021, he made a high-profile transfer to Paris Saint-Germain (PSG). Throughout his career, he has played alongside legendary teammates such as Xavi, Andrés Iniesta, Neymar, and Luis Suárez, and has been managed by world-class coaches including Pep Guardiola, Luis Enrique, and Lionel Scaloni (for the Argentina national team). While specific databases for every referee he has encountered are extensive, he has played under the officiating of many top-tier referees in La Liga, Ligue 1, and international competitions.
