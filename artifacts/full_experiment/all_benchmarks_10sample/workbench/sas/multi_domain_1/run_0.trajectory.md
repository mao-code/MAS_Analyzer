### Final Answer

I have scheduled a 30-minute meeting titled 'Update on Riley Brown' for tomorrow, Friday, December 1st, at 1:00 PM. Since there were no recorded interactions with Riley Brown in the past fortnight and no specific assignee found in the directory, I have scheduled this with Nia Johnson, who is involved in related project checkpoints.
