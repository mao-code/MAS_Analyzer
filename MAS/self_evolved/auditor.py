"""Trace Auditor meta-agent.

Inspects the just-executed turn using process-observable signals only (no
benchmark ground truth is available in-run) and reports detected failure
modes plus whether a topology/context repair is recommended. Mode names
follow the taxonomy in ``scripts/generate_mas_failure_analysis_report.py``
where a process-level analogue exists.

Deterministic heuristics run first. ``audit_mode = "hybrid"`` adds a grounded,
open-set LLM observer that can name process failures outside the fixed taxonomy;
``llm_judge`` retains the legacy ability to override the heuristic repair verdict.
Both model-backed modes fall back to the deterministic report.
